<H3>Generally</H3>

<P>In principle you don't <I>need</I> anything to do this
course other than an Internet enabled computer - which I assume
you have if you are reading this in the first place!
The other thing that is useful is the right <I>mind set</I> to program.
What I mean by that is an innate curiosity about things, coupled
to a logical way of thinking. These are both essential
requirements for a successful programmer.

<P>The curiosity factor comes into play in looking for answers
to problems and being willing to dig around in sometimes obscure
documents for ideas and information needed to complete a task.

<P>The logical thinking comes into play because computers are
intrinsically stupid. They can't really do anything except add
single digits together and move bytes from one place to another.
Luckily for us some talented programmers have written lots of
programs to hide this basic stupidity. But of course as a
programmer you may well get into a new situation where you have
to face that stupidity in its raw state. At that point you have
to think for the computer. You have to figure out exactly what
needs to be done to your data and when.

<P> So much for the philosophy! However if you want to get the
best from the tutorial you will want to follow along, either
typing in the examples by hand or cutting and pasting from the
Web page into your text editor.  Then you can run the programs
and see the results. To do that you will need to have Python
installed on your system (and for the VBScript/JScript examples 
you'll need a browser capable of running those languages. 
Almost any modern browser can run JavaScript.)

<H3>Python</H3>

<P>Python version 2.3 is the latest release at the time of
writing. The Python download is quite big (about 9Mb for
the Windows binary version) but it does include all the 
documentation and lots of tools, some of which we'll look 
at later in the tutorial.
<P> For Linux/Unix you can get the source and build it - see 
your sys admin!! It also comes pre-built (and pre-installed) in 
most Linux distributions these days and packaged versions 
(for Red Hat, Mandrake, Suse and Debian) can be found too. 
In fact you may well find that many of the systems admin 
tools you use on Linux are actually written in Python.

<P>The master download site for Python is:<BR><BR>

<H3>VBScript and JavaScript</H3>
<P>As I said earlier most browsers can run JavaScript without 
any problems. VBScript will only work in Microsoft's Internet 
Explorer. You don't need to install anything for these languages, 
either you have them (on Windows boxes) or you don't
(JavaScript only on Linux). The only thing to watch out for 
is that some paranoid system administrators occasionally turn off
the scripting feature of the browser for security purposes, 
but since so many web sites use JavaScript nowadays that's 
pretty unlikely.
