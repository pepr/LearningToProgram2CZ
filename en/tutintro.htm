<H2>The Web Site</H2>
   <P>Welcome to the new Learning to Program web tutor!
   <P>The site has been completely updated in content and
   now features VBScript and JavaScript as well as Python as 
   example languages. The explanations have been expanded too 
   - almost 30% more material - and I'll be adding a whole set 
   of new topics over the coming months focusing on practical 
   applications of your programming skills.
<BR><BR>
   <P>Oh, and if you still need to see the old version of the 
   tutor, its still available 
   <a href="oldtutor/index.htm" target="top">here</a>.
   
<H2>The Book</H2>
    <P>Latest news on my book is that it has moved to print-on-demand.
    Basically this means that copies are only printed when firm orders are
    received from retailers. Logically this means you are less likely to see it
    in the shops but you can still place an order and it will be delivered, it
    just takes a little longer is all.
   <BR> 
    <P>The book is now significantly different to the new web site 
    although the basics remain the same. It is stuck at Python 
    version 1.5 and doesn't have the new material, although it 
    has extra examples of its own plus several extra chapters 
    compared to the web site.  These include an additional case 
    study for an OO games framework.  
    (A fully commented version of the framework is available on the 
    <A href="http://www.uselesspython.com/">Useless Python</A> website 
    as hmgui.zip.) 

<P>You can order the book on Amazon by clicking  
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201709384/qid=973079752/sr=1-2/102-4340226-7146521">here.</A> 
Most of the other online bookshops have it in stock too.</P>

<P>There is also a 
<A href="http://www.pearsoned.co.jp/washo/prog/wa_pro45-j.html">
Japanese version</A> available from the Japanese branch of my publishers.

<P><B>I now have a 
<A href="http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/book/index.htm">
web site</A> set up listing errata and providing opportunities to
send feedback and questions.</B> Please pay a visit if you've bought 
the book!</P>

<H2>The Future</H2>
<P>As I said above there will be several new topics added as part 
of a completely new section looking at practical applications of 
programming. This is in response to many requests from readers who 
say - "OK, Now I know how to program, but what exactly can I do 
with my new found skills?" 

<p>There is a Polish translation underway and the Czech version 
is being updated to reflect the new version. As ever, Petr has 
been my most exacting reviewer and I thank him for his many 
corrections. Any remaining errors are entirely my fault!

<P>The book is stagnant I'm afraid, but once I get the new topics 
written I might sound the publishers out about a second edition 
updating it to the latest version of Python, whatever that will 
be by then, and adding the new material. But don't hold your 
breath waiting on that one...

<H3>Non English Editions now available!</H3>
<P>Martin Pizza was the first to translate the tutor (into Spanish) 
and he has now been followed by several others. The following versions 
are available:</P>

<P>The tutors above are all usable but at different stages 
of completeness compared to the web site. That's because they 
reflect the state of the web site at the time of translation. 
The Czech one in particular is very professionally presented 
including a very attractive appearance. I was so impressed 
with the style that I have used Petr's stylesheets 
as the basis for this new English version. Hopefully I'll get 
round to changing the other language editions too.
<BR>
<P>I think all of the translators deserve a vote of thanks for their 
efforts in putting this together. It's always better to read a 
translation of an old tutorial than to struggle reading a new 
one in a foreign language! If anyone else wishes to do a translation, 
or update any of the existing ones, just send me an 
<A href="mailto:alan.gauld@btinternet.com">email</A>.
</P>
<BR>
<P>As mentioned above there is a Japanese version of my book 
available too.</P>


<H3>New Stuff</H3>

<P>As of now it's all new! I'll update this section as I get 
round to doing the new topics etc.

<H3>Download Archive Format Change</H3>
<P>
I'll be posting both zip and tgz versions of the site
from time to time. I don't promise that they will be perfectly 
up to date but I'll try not to let them get too far adrift. 
If you want the latest then check the online version.

<P>Linux users can download the  
<A href="tutor.tgz">tar/gzip version</A>.</P>
<BR>
<P>Windows users should be able to use that version too since 
<A href="http://www.winzip.com">winzip</A>
and the freeware archiver
<A href="http://qzip.cjb.net/">Quick Zip</A> 
by Joseph Leung can both cope with tgz format. I'll also be using 
tgz format for the non English versions, just look at the bottom 
of the contents frame for a link.</P> 
<BR>
<P>Finally I have made a basic PDF version available too, 
it doesn't have any fancy navigation features like bookmarks 
and it won't be updated as often as the zip/tgz files 
(because its much more work to do so!). But if you like 
PDF its <a href="tutor.pdf">here</a>.

<BR>

<H3>And Palm Users Too...</H3>
<P>One Palm user has created a 
<A href="tutor.pdb">Palm doc file</A> of the old site. I haven't 
had a chance to try it yet but offer it here for those who want it. 
If anyone has problems with this one then you're on your own, 
it's unsupported. But hopefully it will be useful to someone. 
If you don't have a Palm doc reader you can find a choice of 
freeware ones at 
<a href="http://www.freewarepalm.com/docs/docs_software.shtml">
this site</a>.

<BR>
<H2>Introduction - What, Why, Who etc.</H2>

<H3> Why am I writing this?</H3>

<P>The reason I am creating this tutorial is that there seems to
be very little for the absolute beginner to programming on the
Web. Yet the Internet and the Web encourage interest in
computers and that interest naturally leads to a desire to "take
control", which means learning to program!

<P>Why me? Well I am a 
<a href="computing.htm">professional programmer</A> who came to
programming from an electronic engineering background. I have
used (and continue to use) several <a href="complang.htm">
computer languages</A> and don't have any personal interest in 
promoting any particular tool or language. 
Oh, and when I started, nobody else seemed to be doing it! 
Since then several other tutors for beginners have appeared, 
but this one seems to have acquired enough of a fan base that 
I'll keep it going.</P>

<H3>What will I cover</H3>

<P>As much as I can. I will cover the basic theory of computer
programming - what it is, some of its history and the basic
techniques needed to solve problems. I will not be teaching
esoteric techniques or the details of any particular programming
language, in fact I'll be using several different languages, 
since I believe its important to realize that different 
languages do different things well. That said, the majority of 
the course will be in the language called Python.

<H3>Who should read it?</H3>

<P>Put another way: what do I expect the reader to know
already?

<P>I expect the reader of this tutorial to be an experienced
user of a computer system, probably MS DOS, Windows or Unix
although others should be able to cope too. I also expect them
to understand  some very basic mathematical concepts such as 
geometric coordinates, sets, and basic algebra. These are all 
important in todays programming environments, and many programming 
concepts are based on these ideas. However the depth of knowledge 
needed is very low and if you do find the math getting too hard, 
you can usually just skip over a few paragraphs, try the code as 
it is and hopefully the penny will drop even if the math still 
confuses you.

<P>One thing you should know is how to run commands from your 
operating system's command prompt. In Windows this is variously 
known as a DOS box, the MS DOS Window or MS-DOS Prompt. Basically 
it's a black window with a white text prompt that usually says 
C:\WINDOWS&gt; and you can start it by going to the Start-&gt;Run dialog 
and typing COMMAND into the entry box and hitting OK. If you use 
Linux then you should know all about terminal windows and on MacOS 
you can run the Terminal program under Mac OS X (which is found 
in the Applications-&gt;Utilities folder). 

<P>I will not be covering issues like how to create or copy 
text files, how to install software, or the organization
of files on a computer storage system. Frankly if you need to
know those things you probably are not at the stage of being
able to program, regardless of your desire to do so. Find a
tutorial for your computer first, then when you're confident with
the above concepts revisit this site.

<H3>Why Python?</H3>

<P>Python happens to be a nice language to learn. Its syntax is
simple and it has some very powerful features built into the
language. It supports lots of programming styles from the
very simple through to state of the art Object Oriented
techniques. It runs on lots of platforms - Unix/Linux, MS
Windows, Macintosh etc. It also has a very friendly and helpful
user community. All of these are important features for a
beginner's language.

<P>Python however is not <I>just</I> a beginner's language.
As your experience grows you can keep on using Python either as
an end in itself or as a rapid prototyping language. There are a
few things that Python is not well suited to, but these are
comparatively few and far between.

<P>I will also use VBScript and JavaScript as alternatives. 
The reason for this is to show that the same basic techniques 
apply regardless of the language details. Once you can program 
in one language you can easily pick up a new one in a few days.
Why those languages? Well, for a start they have very different 
styles to Python so form a useful contrast, and more prosaically 
if we accept that most Web surfers who are also beginners 
are using PCs with Microsoft Windows installed, there is a 
programming environment built in to the operating system called 
Windows Scripting Host which has support for VBScript and JScript 
(which is Microsoft's variant of JavaScript). 
In addition anyone using Microsoft's web browser can also use 
these languages within their browser, and in fact JavaScript 
should work in almost any browser. We'll only look at how to 
run VBScript and JavaScript inside a browser, investigating WSH 
I'll leave as an exercise for the interested Windows user!

<H3>Other resources</H3>

<P>There are other Web sites trying to do this in other
languages (and in the time since I originally created this 
site a few other Python sites have appeared). There are also 
lots of tutorials for those who already know how to program 
but want to learn a new language.  This section contains 
links to some of those that I think are worthwhile!

It seems a little bit less comprehensive than mine, but maybe I'm 
just biased :-) 
<LI>Since I first wrote this tutor a whole bunch of non programmer's 
tutorials have appeared and they are listed on the Python web site, 
so you can take your pick. Most of them focus on just getting you 
programming in Python so they don't explain so much of the jargon 
as I do, nor do they explain the Computer Science theory 
like Jeff does. You can find the page
